PHILOSOPHY
================================================================================

This dual licensing reflects our "anti-success" philosophy:

- Ideas (documentation) should be free for everyone to use and build upon
- Code implementations should be free to fork and modify
- Our goal is not to "own" this concept, but to see it spread and evolve

If you create a better implementation, you don't need our permission.
If you prove our ideas wrong, you've helped us learn.
If this concept becomes ubiquitous, we've succeeded.

"The goal is not to be remembered, but for the idea to be forgotten 
because it has become the new normal."
